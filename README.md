# Piscina

This repository contains the work I completed during the **Piscine** at **42 Urduliz**, a one-month intensive coding bootcamp. When I started this journey, I had no prior experience programming in C or working in such a high-pressure environment. Over the course of a week, I faced challenges that tested my ability to learn quickly, manage frustration, and adapt to new concepts.

## About the Piscine

The Piscine is designed to immerse participants in the fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, and collaboration. It is a transformative experience that pushes individuals to their limits, fostering both technical and personal growth. The projects in this repository reflect the skills I developed during this time.

## Key Competencies Developed

- **C Programming**: Learning the syntax, memory management, and debugging techniques in C.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling algorithmic challenges and finding efficient solutions under time constraints.
- **Teamwork**: Collaborating with peers during group projects (Rushes), which required clear communication, task delegation, and conflict resolution.
- **Resilience**: Managing frustration and staying motivated despite the steep learning curve and intense workload.
- **Version Control**: Using tools like Git to manage and track code changes effectively.

## Highlights

I am particularly proud of how I overcame my initial lack of experience and adapted to the fast-paced environment. The **Rushes** (team projects) were a standout experience, as they taught me the value of teamwork and how to build something meaningful with others under tight deadlines.

## Structure of the Repository

This repository contains the deliverables I submitted during the Piscine. Each project showcases a specific aspect of the skills I developed:

- **Exercises**: Small, focused tasks to practice fundamental programming concepts.
- **Rushes**: Collaborative projects that required teamwork and integration of multiple components.
- **Final Projects**: Larger, more complex tasks that tested my overall understanding and ability to apply what I learned.

## Modules Overview

The repository is organized into the following modules:

1. **Libft**: A custom implementation of standard C library functions. This module helped me understand memory management, string manipulation, and other low-level operations in C.
2. **Get_Next_Line**: A project focused on reading a line from a file descriptor. It taught me how to handle dynamic memory allocation and work with buffers efficiently.
3. **Printf**: A recreation of the `printf` function in C. This module deepened my understanding of variadic functions and formatting output.
4. **Born2BeRoot**: A system administration project where I configured a virtual machine. It introduced me to Linux, shell scripting, and basic server management.
5. **Rushes**: Team-based projects that required collaboration to build functional programs under tight deadlines. These projects emphasized teamwork, communication, and integration of multiple components.

## Reflection

The Piscine was the beginning of my journey as a developer. It taught me not only how to code but also how to approach challenges with determination and a growth mindset. This experience laid the foundation for the developer I am today, and I am grateful for the lessons I learned along the way.
